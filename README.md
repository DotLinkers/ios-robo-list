# ios-robo-list
This repository contain a short and simple task, for you to finish.
If you want to start - clone it and open the project.

### What do you need to know to start?
Not much actually. There is simple network request - one to be precise. Some very basic UI stuff. You should be familiar with Swift good practices, and that's all you need to know.  
Everythig should take you no more then 2 hours.

### What do we have here?
Application is already created. It gets a string and displays random robot images based on given string. Try it.
And now check the code. It's messy, isn't it? Thanks hevens that it's a small app, otherwise it would be much harder to understand anything.

### What is your task?
- There is a lot of `TODO`s left in code. Feel free to complete them.
- Apart of that you should know that there is a suite of unit tests that are currently failing. It would be nice if you can change that (without changing tests of course).
- One of missing features is persistence. Can you please make it remember already fetched images? There are no restrictions about finishing this task. Use anything that you think will suit here the most.
- Second of missing features is `fetchRobotsButton`. Please add it next to text field. Make text field shorter and add button on right side of textField. Make left `roboNameField` margin equal to right margin of `fetchRobotsButton`. Use Constraints when doing so.
- Propose error handling for Network issues. This is totally optional. But you can get a candy for that... And fame... And some additional points... (I'm just joking. There are no points.)
- Mind code style. We value people whose code is easy to understand. Probably I should start with mentioning that.
- Sometimes it crashes :( It would be very nice of you if you could prevent that from happening.
